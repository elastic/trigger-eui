/**
 * This is a hack.
 *
 * Right now, Next doesn't work well when you try to combine an assetPrefix,
 * static site generation and dynamic routing. This may well be resolved
 * by introducing a `basePath` option, but for now, monkey-patch the router
 * to remove any `assetPrefix` (which is called a `pathPrefix` here) before
 * forwarding on a route matcher to the original router.
 *
 * If you're not using static site generation (SSG), or using SSG but without
 * dynamic routes, then you don't need this and can safely remove it.
